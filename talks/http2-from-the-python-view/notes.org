* h2 and twisted demonstration
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm_o81n6qYA
** h2
   Hyper-h2 is a framework independent library
** twisted support
   You can easily run static site over twisted web server with http/2
   support.  You write the same command as you do with python -m
   http.server but for twisted.
** firefox support
   You can access this site on local host over http/2 from your browser
** mitmproxy support
   https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy is a developer tool capable
   to intercept http/2 requests.  It's written in python and built on
   top of h2 library.
** curl support
   Curl now have --http2 flag.
*** DONE how it works?
* other tools support
** DONE aiohttp
** DONE tornado
* DONE Django channels
* PyCon UK 2014: HTTP/2: Because The Web Was Too Easy
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpwOiucVlIo
** HTTP/1.1 floss
   - HTTP now have 6 RFC, but still looks quiet simple.
   - Transfer chunk encoding is the most popular issue in http 1
     servers and clients.
   - HTTP 1 is slow (mostly it will open new TCP connection).
   - HTTP pipelining doesn't work either (even browsers can't
     implement it correctly)
   - Lots of workarounds like spiriting, inlining (base64 - who needs
     compression efficiency :) and resource concatenation, sharding
     (CSS on different domains).  All this fucks up caching.  CDN
     business runs mostly on the existence of this problem.
** HTTP/2
   - The SPDY by google.
   - HTTP/2 is a binary protocol.
     *HTTP/2 in its core a binary framing layer for HTTP/1*.
   - Multiplexing with priority and flow control.
   - Header compression.
   - Early stream termination.
   - Server push.
   - Focus on browsers :(
   - Crazy control flow diagram picture.

  - text protocols are really tricky to parse
  - HTTP/2 is fucking stateful nightmare :(
  - HTTP/1 vs HTTP/2 gopher download image contest
  - http2bin.org
  - server push may be implemented for nghttp2 with extra headers
